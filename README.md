# Welcome-to-the-Zoo
This program serves as a virtual zoo, to test the functionalities of the Animal Class, and its subclasses, in a GUI format.

This class simply displays the 4 animal JButtons into a JPanel, with 4 corresponding cages. When an animal is pressed, the object classes take care of moving themselves, which means this Zoo class has almost no code in its ActionListener. Aside from the constructors, the Zoo class also has a method to get the location of a cage and pass it to an animal.
